To build subsequences of a string using Python.

A subsequence of a string is the string which is obtained by deleting one or more characters from another string. Empty string is the subsequence of all strings. All subsequences of 'abc' is ['a','ab','abc','ac','b','bc','c','']. Sometimes it's called powerset.

The constrant is that the string uses different characters.
